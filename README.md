# Automating Pull Request Deployment with Docker and GitHub Actions

## Automating Pull Request Deployment with Docker and GitHub Actions

In this task, you will design and implement a robust automated deployment system using Docker and GitHub Actions. The goal is to deploy pull requests (PRs) into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes. Additionally, you'll create a GitHub bot that provides real-time deployment status updates and links within the PR threads. This system should efficiently handle updates with new commits and clean up containers upon PR closure to ensure optimal resource utilization.

Requirements
1. Docker Containerization:
    - Implement a Docker-based deployment system where each new PR opens a fresh container to deploy the branch.
    - Update the existing container with new commits upon subsequent pushes to the PR branch.
2. GitHub Actions Integration:
    - Utilize GitHub Actions workflows to automate the deployment process.
    - Trigger deployments on PR creation and update events.
    - Comment on the PR with deployment status and relevant information.
3. GitHub Bot Development:
    - Develop a GitHub bot that interacts with PRs.
    - Automatically comment on PRs with deployment status, including links to the deployed environment.
    - Ensure the bot cleans up containers and resources associated with closed PRs.
4. Documentation and Ease of Adoption:
    - Provide clear documentation on setting up and configuring the deployment system.
    - Ensure the system is well-documented for easy adoption by other developers and teams.

Tasks to Accomplish
1. Infrastructure Setup:
    - Configure Docker environment for automated deployments.
    - Set up necessary servers or cloud infrastructure to host Docker containers.
2. GitHub Actions Configuration:
    - Create GitHub Actions workflows to manage PR deployment lifecycle.
    - Implement deployment triggers and actions for container updates and cleanup.
3. Bot Development:
    - Develop a GitHub bot using GitHub Apps.
    - Integrate the bot with deployment workflows to provide status updates.
4. Testing and Validation:
    - Test the deployment system with sample PRs and different scenarios.
    - Ensure reliability, scalability, and security of the deployment process.
5. Documentation and Deployment Guide:
    - Document the setup and usage of the deployment system in GitHub Wiki or equivalent.
    - Include troubleshooting steps and best practices for maintaining the system.

Acceptance Criteria
- PR Deployment: PRs trigger Docker container deployment with each new commit.
- GitHub Bot Integration: Bot comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- Container Management: Containers are updated with new commits and cleaned up upon PR closure.
- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation enables easy adoption and maintenance of the deployment system.

Review Process:
- Your contribution will be reviewed based on your impact on the team’s success.
- Evaluations will be made by your team lead and project mentor.
- If your team lead isn’t managing things well, stay in touch with your project mentor.
